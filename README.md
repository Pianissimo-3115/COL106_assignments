# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Course Assignments

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms as part of the DSA course assignments. Each assignment focuses on applying specific data structures to solve practical problems.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Maze Traversal
- **Objective**: Navigate through a maze from start to end while avoiding randomly placed obstacles.
- **Approach**: Implemented a depth-first search (DFS) style traversal using a stack to find a viable path through the maze.

### Assignment 2: AVL Tree and Bin Packing
- **Objective**: Use an AVL tree to manage a bin packing system where objects, based on their colors, have specific bin preferences.
- **Approach**: Implemented an AVL tree to ensure balanced insertions and deletions, optimizing the placement of objects into bins.

### Assignment 3: Heap for Treasury Management
- **Objective**: Manage a treasury system where multiple pirates process treasures, ensuring the least loaded pirate takes the next treasure.
- **Approach**: Developed a heap data structure to efficiently track and assign treasures to pirates with the minimum current load.

### Assignment 4: Hash Table for Library Management
- **Objective**: Maintain three different book libraries and efficiently handle book and word operations.
- **Approach**: Implemented a hash table with three collision resolution techniques—linear probing, chaining, and double hashing—to support efficient insertions, searches, and deletions.

### Assignment 5: Flight Network and Pathfinding
- **Objective**: Manage a network of flights between cities and find optimal paths.
- **Approach**: Utilized Dijkstra’s algorithm and a modified breadth-first search (BFS) to compute shortest paths between different cities in the flight network.
